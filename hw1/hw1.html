(* <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
In class we discussed the five types of errors encountered: lexical, syntactical, static semantic, dynamic semantic, and logical. The following C program has several errors (all of which include a line comment). For each error, state which category it falls under with a short explanation.

As we discussed in class, the line between certain errors can be blurry; hence, the explanation you provide is more important than a specific "right" answer, but be brief, no more than a single sentence is required.

#include <stdio.h>
char a1; b1;        // Error #1
int arr[10]         // Error #2
long x = 123@;      // Error #3

int chg(long fr) {
  if (fr = 0) {     // Error #4
    x = 10.99;      // Error #5
    arr[10] = 10;   // Error #6
  } else {
    arr[1] = 1;
  }
}

int main (void) {
  char union = 'a'; // Error #7
  float x;
  union = chg(arr); // Error #8
  return 0;
}

(* <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
Download and compile <a href="powI.c">powI.c</a> to assembly code on your machine: Use the command <code>gcc -S powI_sample.c</code>

Although C is considered a high-level language it really is only a few steps up from assembly. You should be able to recognize a simple correspondence between the C code and the compiled assembly code. Annotate the generated assembly code (you may copy and paste it in this file and annotate by line): Look for the key points, there is no need to label each instruction.

In particular, you should recognize and label the following:
  1. The creation of the stack frame.
  2. Argument storage and updates.
  3. Local variable storage and updates.
  4. Translation of the loop.
  5. Some form of return result, and an exit from the function. *)

(* <h4>Problem 2 Answer:</h4> *)

(* <h3>Problem 3:</h3>
Download and compile <a href="pow_full.c">pow_full.c</a>: Use the command <code>gcc -Wall pow_full.c -o pow </code> (it's always a good idea to compile with -Wall). You may run it with any integer input <code>./pow 2</code> .

The function <b>powI</b> is obviously an iterative implementation of an integer power function.
  1. Add a new function, <b>powF</b>, that implements integer power using a <i>functional style</i>: You should recursively call <b>powF</b> and use no loops. Adjust the main function to call <b>powF</b> instead.
  2. Briefly discuss the computation complexity of both implementations of power (big-oh notation); one sentence will do.
  3. In a language where you have the flexibility to implement an algorithm iteratively and recursively why would you choose one over the other?
*)

(* <h4>Problem 3 Answer:</h4>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int powI(int pow, int base) {
  int acc, p;
  for (acc=1,p=0; p < pow; p++) {
    acc = acc * base;
  }
  return acc;
}

int powF(int pow, int base) {
  if(pow == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return base * powF(pow-1, base);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc < 3) {
    printf("%s usage: [BASE] [POWER]\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }
  int base = atoi(argv[1]);
  int pow = atoi(argv[2]);
  int r = powF(pow,base);
  printf("%d\n", r);
  return 0;
}
//2.  the big-o of each implementation os O(n)
//3.  the choice between recursion and itteration largely depends on what language you're using and wheather
// readability or efficiency is more important to you.  Some languages don't support recursion (although this
//is almost unheard of in modern languages) while some functional languages have only recursion and make itteration
//difficult or impossible.  Recursion often is considered more readable, however that can be subjective.
//Ultimately recursion requires the stack to be manipulated and maintained while itteration relies on consistant
//variables.  If this small difference will influence performance than it could be said the decision between the two
//should be made off that.
*)

(* <h3>Problem 4:</h3>
Statically typed languages have their advantages, but sometimes it really is simpler to use a dynamic language.

The following is a simple implementation of factorial in Python: <a href="fact.py">fact.py</a> *)
#! /usr/bin/env python

import sys

def fact(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * fact(n-1)

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
  print("%s usage: [NUMBER]" % sys.argv[0])
  exit()

print(fact(int(sys.argv[1])))

(* The following is a simple implementation of factorial in Ruby: <a href="fact.rb">fact.rb</a> *)
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def fact(n)
  return 1 if n == 0
  return n * fact(n-1)
end

if ARGV.length != 1
  puts "fact.rb usage: [NUMBER]"
  exit
end

puts fact(ARGV[0].to_i)

(* Rewrite <b>powI</b> and <b>powF</b> from pow_full.c in Python and Ruby (they will syntactically and semantically be very similar).

In particular:
(1) Create a file named pow_full.py that contains an implementation of powI and powF in Python.
(2) Create a file named pow_full.rb that contains an implementation of powI and powF in Ruby.

Make sure to place the code in this file as well. *)

    s= s*n

if len(sys.argv) != 3:

(* <h3>Problem 5:</h3>
In your local implementation of C, what is the limit on the size of integers? (You can use /usr/include/limits.h to figure out the range of values of type int.)  What happens in the event of arithmetic overflow? What are the implications of size limits on the portability of programs from one machine/compiler to another? How do the answers to these questions differ for Java? for Python? for Haskell? *)

(* <h4>Problem 5 Answer:</h4>
maximums
----------------------
int:		2147483647
unsigned int:	4294967295

if the maximum integer size is language, not platform dependent then the code is more portable
because developers do not need to worry about the compiler and hardware of a different system
enforcing a different max int than they predicted.  Languages which are interpreted or patially
interpreted have this advantage as their max int is tied to their vm/interpritation/implimentation

*)

(* <h3>Problem 6:</h3>
In class we discussed how the <i>traditional</i> definition of a compiler is rarely used in practice anymore -- some exceptions obviously still apply; in reality, many languages use a combination of compilation and interpretation techniques.

Pick a language that <b>is not</b> on the following list (i.e, pick a modern language that we have not discussed), and discuss its compilation process. Part of the point of this question is for you to explore how some languages you are not familiar with work, so spend a little time doing some research.
- C
- C++
- Java
- Ruby
- Python
- Go
- Fortran
- Pascal
*)


(* <h4>Problem 6 Answer:</h4>
  Rust is a compiled language much like c++, it has many
  of the same features and intricacies, however has a number of nuances which set it apart.

  Rusts most distinguishing characteristic is it's memory safety

  Rust has guarenteed memory safety while still allowing developers
  to use a number of types of (smart) pointers.

  The ability to account for memory safety without garbage
  collection is huge, particularly in embeded systems
  or other programs which require low downtime and
  speedy/timely calculation.

  Rust is still in its infancy but is gaining functionality and traction quickly.
*)

(* <h3>Problem 7:</h3>
Operator precedence and associativity are often subtle details that are overlooked when using a language (and require careful treatment when implementing a compiler). One way around this issue is to use prefix or postfix notation. This is not as foreign as you think, every function call is in prefix notation: 2 powI 3 is just as valid as + 2 3.

Rewrite the expressions (a-d) below in prefix notation according to the precedence and associativity rules given:
<table style="width:25%">
<tr><td>Binary Op</td><td>Precedence</td><td>Associativity</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>3</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>/</td><td>3</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>2</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>@</td><td>1</td><td>Right</td></tr>
</table>

The algorithm for rewriting is very straightforward:
(1) Paranthesis each expression using the rules for precedence and associativity.
(2) For each paranthesized expression, move the operator to the left of the operands for prefix notation (right of the operands for postfix).
(3) Remove the parantheses.

The operands will have the same order in the resulting expressions (due to the restriction that the operators are NOT commulatative).

The expressions:
(a) z + w @ x @ y
(b) w + (x + y * z)
(c) w * x * y ^ z
(d) w / x * y / z
*)

(* <h4>Problem 7 Answer:</h4>
(a)@@+zwxy
(b)++*yzxw
(c)@**wxyz
(d)/*/wxyz
*)

(* <h3>Problem 8:</h3>
Repeat Problem 7, but use <b>postfix</b> notation instead.


*)

(* <h4>Problem 8 Answer:</h4>

(a)zw+x@y@
(b)wxyz*++
(c)wx*y*z@
(d)wx/y*z/
*)

(* <h3>Problem 9:</h3>
Ackermann's function plays an important role in the theory of recursive functions and in the study of complexity of certain algorithms involving set unions. In the early days of imperative languages, Ackermann's function was used to measure the recursion capability of a compiler.

<code>
ack(m,n) =    n + 1                   if m = 0
ack(m,n) =    ack(m-1,1)              if n = 0 and m > 0
ack(m,n) =    ack(m-1,ack(m, n-1))    if n > 0 and m > 0
</code>

Using the Ackermann definition given implement a function <b>ack</b> in C, Python, and Ruby.

In particular:
(1) Create a file named ack.c and implement <b>ack</b> in C. Try and find the largest Ackermann number for your program.
(2) Create a file named ack.py and implement <b>ack</b> in Python. Try and find the largest Ackermann number for your program.
(3) Create a file named ack.rb and implement <b>ack</b> in Ruby. Try and find the largest Ackermann number for your program. *)

        return ack(m-1, 1);
    if(n>0 and m > 0):
        return ack(m-1,ack(m, n-1));
    return 1;



if len(sys.argv) != 2:
  print("%s usage: [NUMBER]" % sys.argv[0])
